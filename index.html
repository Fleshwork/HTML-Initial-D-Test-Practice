    Takumi Fujiwara is the son of Bunta Fujiwara, the owner of a tofu shop in his hometown Akina. He rarely shows emotion. His best friend is Itsuki Takeuchi, who is a racing fan. Takumi looks docile and weak minded, but he is stubborn and
    strong-willed, many remarks are said about that. Yuuichi figure out he was like his father in his behavior. However, to those who have raced against him, Takumi possesses tremendous concentration and instinctive insight once behind the wheel (and
    these qualities are most evident when he is chasing after his opponent).
